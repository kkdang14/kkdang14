## 🚀 Featured Projects

- [KAN4ICH](https://github.com/kkdang14/KAN4ICH) (In progress)
  *This is a Machine Learning project focused on researching the Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) architecture as an alternative to traditional MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) networks. The research is conducted on an image dataset featuring intangible cultural heritages of Vietnam. The project involves training, evaluating, and adapting the KAN architecture to better fit the unique characteristics of the dataset. Through this work, we aim to explore the potential of KANs in image classification tasks and contribute insights into how new neural architectures can support the preservation and understanding of cultural heritage.*

- [VietInstrument](https://github.com/kkdang14/VietInstrument)  
  *In this project, I focus on exploring Transformer-based models for multimodal fusion of images and text. Specifically, I utilize the pre-trained PhoBERT model for Vietnamese language text and the Vision Transformer (ViT) for image processing. The dataset centers around traditional Vietnamese musical instruments. The primary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of combining text and image models (fusion) for classification and understanding tasks, and to convey the importance of preserving and promoting Vietnamese cultural heritage through technology.*
